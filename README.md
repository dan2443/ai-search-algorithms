# ai-search-algorithms
In this project my goal was to use AI Search Algorithms in a maze to find the target point from the starting point.

## First look on the maze

The starting point in the maze is marked in light blue and the target point is marked in red. The points are set randomly in every start of the program. To start a search, press on the right mouse button and choose the desired search algorithm.

## AI Search Algorithms
The algorithms that are implemented in this project are:

- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Best-first Search
- A* search

## The result

The route which was found by the search algorithm is marked in pink.
